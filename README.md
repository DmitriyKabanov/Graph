# Graph API

Simple Graph lib:

Should support 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations:
addVertex - adds vertex to the graph
addEdge - adds edge to the graph
getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path doesnâ€™t have to be optimal)

Vertices should be of a user defined type.
